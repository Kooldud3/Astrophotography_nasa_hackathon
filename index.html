            <h2>What Equipment Do You Need?</h2>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Smartphone</h3>
                    <p>With just a smartphone, you can capture the moon, star trails, and even some planets. Apps like <strong>NightCap</strong> help improve long-exposure photography.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>DSLR or Mirrorless Camera</h3>
                    <p>A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual controls allows you to capture sharp, detailed images of the moon, planets, and stars. A sturdy tripod and remote shutter are essential.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Telescope</h3>
                    <p>A telescope is perfect for zooming in on planets, craters of the moon, and even distant galaxies. Attach your DSLR or use a dedicated astro-camera for long exposures.</p>
                </div>

        <!-- Remote Telescopes & Data Processing -->
        <section id="remote" class="section">
            <h2>No Equipment? Use Remote Telescopes or Space Data</h2>
            <p>If you donâ€™t have access to a telescope, you can still engage in astrophotography using remote telescopes from networks like <a href="https://www.itelescope.net/" target="_blank">iTelescope</a> or <a href="https://telescope.live/home" target="_blank">  Telescope Live</a>. Additionally, you can process real data from telescopes like the <strong>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</strong> or the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</strong> to create stunning astrophotography!</p>

        <!-- Near-Earth Objects -->
        <section id="neo" class="section">
            <h2>Photographing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)</h2>
            <p>Near-Earth objects, such as asteroids and comets, are fascinating celestial bodies. Using a telescope and long-exposure techniques, you can capture these fast-moving objects as they pass close to Earth.</p>
            <ul class="how-to-list">
                <li>Use a wide-field telescope to track the movement of NEOs.</li>
                <li>Take long-exposure images to capture their path across the night sky.</li>
                <li>Check websites like <a href="https://www.cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA's CNEOS</a> to track upcoming NEO passes.</li>

            <h2>How to Capture Celestial Objects</h2>
            <p>Here's a brief guide on how to photograph various celestial objects:</p>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Sun</h3>
                    <img src="sun.jpg" alt="Sun Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Never photograph the Sun without a proper solar filter! You can capture sunspots, eclipses, and even solar flares.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Moon</h3>
                    <p>For stunning moon photos, use a camera with a telephoto lens or telescope. Focus on capturing details of craters and the moon's phases.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Mars & Jupiter</h3>
                    <p>Mars and Jupiter can be photographed using a telescope and a planetary camera or DSLR. Capture Mars' reddish hue and Jupiter's bands and moons.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Saturn</h3>
                    <p>Saturn's rings make it a favorite target. Use a telescope and capture this beauty by stacking multiple images for clarity.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Meteor Showers</h3>
                    <p>Use a wide-angle lens, a tripod, and long exposures to capture multiple meteors during peak showers. Timing is key!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Comets</h3>
                    <p>Comets are spectacular. Track their location using star charts or apps and photograph their glowing tails with long exposures.</p>
