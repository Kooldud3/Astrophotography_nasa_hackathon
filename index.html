            <h2>Photographing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)</h2>
            <p>Near-Earth objects, such as asteroids and comets, are fascinating celestial bodies. Using a telescope and long-exposure techniques, you can capture these fast-moving objects as they pass close to Earth.</p>
            <ul class="how-to-list">
                <li>Use a wide-field telescope to track the movement of NEOs.</li>
                <li>Take long-exposure images to capture their path across the night sky.</li>

            <h2>How to Capture Celestial Objects</h2>
            <p>Here's a brief guide on how to photograph various celestial objects:</p>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Sun</h3>
                    <img src="sun.jpg" alt="Sun Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Observing the Sun requires extreme caution to avoid eye damage. Never look directly at the Sun without proper solar filters. To observe sunspots or solar flares, use a telescope with a solar filter securely placed over the front aperture, or use dedicated solar telescopes that block harmful rays. Solar filters must meet ISO 12312-2 standards for safe viewing. Alternatively, you can use solar projection methods with binoculars or a telescope to project the Sun’s image onto a flat surface. Always check the equipment for safety before observing, and never use regular sunglasses or unapproved filters.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Moon</h3>
                    <img src="moon.jpg" alt="Moon Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>For stunning lunar observations, use a telescope with a minimum aperture of 4 inches (100 mm) to clearly see craters and lunar features. Binoculars can also be effective for casual viewing. Best times to observe are during the first or last quarter phases for better shadow contrast on the surface. Find a dark location away from city lights for optimal viewing.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Mars & Jupiter</h3>
                    <img src="jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>For Mars, use a 6-inch (150 mm) telescope during opposition to observe surface details and polar ice caps. For Jupiter, a 4-inch (100 mm) telescope will reveal its cloud bands and major moons, especially during opposition. Using planetary filters can enhance visibility, and clear skies with low humidity provide the best viewing conditions for both planets.Capture Mars' reddish hue and Jupiter's bands and moons.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Saturn</h3>
                    <img src="saturn.jpg" alt="Saturn Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Saturn's rings make it a favorite target.Saturn, the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the solar system, is famous for its iconic ring system made of ice, rock, and dust. With over 80 moons, including Titan—known for its thick atmosphere and methane lakes—Saturn's atmosphere primarily consists of hydrogen and helium. At an average distance of 1.4 billion kilometers from the Sun, Saturn presents a stunning celestial target.To observe Saturn's rings, a telescope with an aperture of at least 6 inches (150 mm) is recommended. Start with lower magnification to fully view the rings, then increase it to reveal intricate details within the ring structure. The best time to observe Saturn is during opposition, when it is closest to Earth. Choose a clear night with minimal atmospheric turbulence for optimal visibility.</p>

                    <h3>Meteor Showers</h3>
                    <img src="meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Use a wide-angle lens, a tripod, and long exposures to capture multiple meteors during peak showers.The best way to observe meteor showers is to find a dark location with an unobstructed view of the sky. Peak activity typically occurs after midnight. Timing is key!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Comets</h3>
                    <img src="comet.jpg" alt="Comet Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Comets are icy bodies composed of rock, dust, and frozen gases, originating from the distant Oort Cloud or Kuiper Belt. When they approach the Sun, the heat causes their ices to vaporize, creating a glowing coma and tail. These celestial visitors can sometimes be visible to the naked eye as they pass through the inner solar system. To observe a comet, binoculars or a small telescope (4–6 inches or 100–150 mm aperture) will reveal the coma and tail more clearly. The best viewing times are in the hours before dawn or after dusk, depending on the comet’s position. Dark skies, far from city lights, will enhance visibility. Be sure to check current astronomy resources for the comet's location in the sky, as they change rapidly. Track their location using star charts or apps and photograph their glowing tails with long exposures.</p>
