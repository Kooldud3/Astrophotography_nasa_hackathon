                    <h3>Smartphone</h3>
                    <p>With just a smartphone, you can capture the moon, star trails, and even some planets. Apps like <strong>NightCap</strong> help improve long-exposure photography.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>DSLR or Mirrorless Camera</h3>
                    <p>A DSLR or mirrorless camera with manual controls allows you to capture sharp, detailed images of the moon, planets, and stars. A sturdy tripod and remote shutter are essential.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Telescope</h3>
                    <p>A telescope is perfect for zooming in on planets, craters of the moon, and even distant galaxies. Attach your DSLR or use a dedicated astro-camera for long exposures.</p>

        <!-- Remote Telescopes & Data Processing -->
        <section id="remote" class="section">
            <h2>No Equipment? Use Remote Telescopes or Space Data</h2>
            <p>If you donâ€™t have access to a telescope, you can still engage in astrophotography using remote telescopes from networks like <a href="https://www.itelescope.net/" target="_blank">iTelescope</a> or <a href="https://telescope.live/home" target="_blank">  Telescope Live</a>. Additionally, you can process real data from telescopes like the <strong>Hubble Space Telescope (HST)</strong> or the <strong>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</strong> to create stunning astrophotography!</p>

        <!-- Near-Earth Objects -->
        <section id="neo" class="section">
            <h2>Photographing Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)</h2>
            <p>Near-Earth objects, such as asteroids and comets, are fascinating celestial bodies. Using a telescope and long-exposure techniques, you can capture these fast-moving objects as they pass close to Earth.</p>
            <ul class="how-to-list">
                <li>Use a wide-field telescope to track the movement of NEOs.</li>
                <li>Take long-exposure images to capture their path across the night sky.</li>
                <li>Check websites like <a href="https://www.cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">NASA's CNEOS</a> to track upcoming NEO passes.</li>

        <!-- Celestial Object Photography Tips -->
        <section id="object-tips" class="section">
            <h2>How to Capture Celestial Objects</h2>
            <p>Here's a brief guide on how to photograph various celestial objects:</p>
            <div class="card-container">
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Sun</h3>
                    <img src="sun.jpg" alt="Sun Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>To safely observe the Sun, use a telescope with an ISO 12312-2 solar filter or a solar telescope. Alternatively, project its image using binoculars. Never look directly at the Sun or use regular sunglasses.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>The Moon</h3>
                    <img src="moon.jpg" alt="Moon Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>For clear lunar views, use a 4-inch (100 mm) telescope or binoculars. The best time to observe is during the first or last quarter phases. Choose a dark location away from city lights for optimal results.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Mars & Jupiter</h3>
                    <img src="jupiter.jpg" alt="Jupiter Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Use a 6-inch (150 mm) telescope for Mars and a 4-inch (100 mm) for Jupiter, especially during opposition, to see surface details, cloud bands, and moons. Planetary filters and clear skies enhance visibility for both.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Saturn</h3>
                    <img src="saturn.jpg" alt="Saturn Image" class="object-img">
                    <img src="casini.jpg" alt="Saturn Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Use a 6-inch (150 mm) telescope to view Saturn's rings. Start with low magnification, then increase for details. The best time is during opposition on clear, calm nights.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Meteor Showers</h3>
                    <img src="meteor.jpg" alt="Meteor Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Use a wide-angle lens, tripod, and long exposures to capture meteors. For the best view, find a dark spot after midnight during peak activity. Timing is key!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Comets</h3>
                    <img src="comet.jpg" alt="Comet Image" class="object-img">
                    <p>Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is set to make its closest approach to Earth in October 2024, with the best viewing times expected between October 15th and 20th. Known as the "Comet of the Century," this comet is likely to be bright enough to see with the naked eye, but using binoculars or a telescope will provide a better view of its coma and tail. For the best experience, try to observe it shortly after sunset or before sunrise, especially from dark areas away from city lights.</p>
